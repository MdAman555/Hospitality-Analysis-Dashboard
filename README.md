1‚Äì2 sentences explaining what the dashboard does and why it exists.

Example: 
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality Industry for the past 20 years.
Due to strategic moves from the other competitors and ineffective management decision-making, AtliQ Grand is losing its market share and revenue 
in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate"Business and Data intelligence"

Their Revenue Management team had decided to hire a third-party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

‚Ä¢	Business Impact & Insights
 1. Revenue Performance Insight
Total Revenue: ‚Çπ90M generated, with the highest contributor being Atliq Bay (‚Çπ21M).
RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room): ‚Çπ9.72K ‚Äî a key profitability measure. Consistent performance indicates stable pricing and occupancy strategies.
Realisation %: 70.89% shows room for improvement in actual bookings versus sellable rooms. Better alignment of demand forecasting and pricing could raise this.
üìä 2. Occupancy & Pricing Efficiency
Occupancy %: 57.37% across properties, with Atliq Blu and Atliq Bay leading in efficiency (>63%).
ADR (Average Daily Rate): ‚Çπ16.95K, steady across weeks (seen in the area chart), but RevPAR starts to dip post W20. This signals a drop in occupancy, not price cuts.
DSRN: 101 average daily sellable room nights, showing consistent inventory availability.
üß© 3. Property-wise Insights
Atliq Bay and Atliq City have higher average ratings (‚â•4.25), better occupancy, and strong revenue ‚Äî ideal benchmark properties.
Atliq Exotica shows the lowest occupancy (45.48%) and average rating (3.09) ‚Äî needs operational review or repositioning.
Cancellation Rate: Highest at Atliq City (23.87%) ‚Äî potential issue with guest experience or overbooking practices.
üìâ 4. Trend Insights (Line & Area Chart)
Post week W20, RevPAR and Occupancy % decline significantly while ADR remains flat ‚Äî suggests rooms are priced correctly, but demand dropped.
Calls for promotional offers, seasonal packages, or campaigns during those weeks to boost occupancy.
üßÅ 5. Category-Based Segmentation (Donut Chart)
Luxury category contributes ~60% of occupancy, compared to 56% from Business ‚Äî suggesting that luxury rooms are more in demand.
Encourages focusing resources, services, and marketing towards the luxury segment for revenue maximization.
üì± 6. Booking Platform Analysis
ADR and Realisation % are relatively even across platforms, but direct online channels appear slightly better.
Suggests investing more in own-brand promotions to reduce dependency on third-party platforms and improve margins.

‚úÖ Actionable Recommendations
* Boost Occupancy in low-performing properties like Atliq Exotica via promotions or market repositioning.
* Analyze Customer Feedback for properties with low ratings (e.g., Atliq Palace, Exotica).
* Explore Dynamic Pricing for underperforming weeks to improve RevPAR.
* Leverage Top Channels like Direct Online & Tripstar with targeted campaigns.
* Focus on Luxury segment expansion given higher demand and revenue impact.
